# Exploitation

## Overview

In this step, we exploit the identified vulnerabilities on the target Windows 7 system to gain unauthorized access. We use tools like Metasploit to perform these exploits.

## Tools Used

- Metasploit
- MSFvenom
- Villain-Kali Linux

## Steps and Commands

### Exploit: EternalBlue (MS17-010)
To exploit the eternal blue vulnerability, I used the metasploit framework to conduct the exploiting as show below:

**Tool: Metasploit**
```bash
search eternalblue
```
![Eternal_Blue](../03-Exploitation/eternalblue1.png)


```bash
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOST 192.168.88.13
exploit
```
![Eternal_Blue](../03-Exploitation/eternalblue2.png)

*Description: This Metasploit module exploits the EternalBlue vulnerability to gain remote code execution.*

After this, I couldn't establish the connection between the windows 7 machine and the Kali Linux attacking machine, so i set up a network in VirtualBox and joined the machines to the same network. After doing this, I managed to get a meterpreter shell to the Windows 7 by exploiting the Eternal Blue vulnerability as shown Below:

*Description: Here I ran some basic network commands and system commands to get more information on the target operating system.*

### Finding:
As seen on the screenshots above, I managed to get meterpreter shells to the Windows 7 machine, thus creating and compromising the system. This shows the severity of the EternalBlue exploit if not patched. 
It can lead to entire system compromization and huge consequences.

### Exploit: BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708)

**Tool: Metasploit**
```bash
use exploit/windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce
set RHOST 192.168.88.13
exploit
```

*Description: This Metasploit module exploits the BlueKeep vulnerability to gain remote code execution.*

### Exploit: Villain Back-Door
Here, I used villain in Kali to generate a back door that will allow me access to the system.

![Villain](../03-Exploitation/villain1.png)

After creating the Back-Door, I set up a handler with msfconsole to listen for the connection:

![Villain](../03-Exploitation/villain2.png)

After this, I successfully got a meterpreter shell to the target system.



## Findings

- **Successful Exploits:** We managed to exploit a lot of vulnerabilities as detailed in the screenshots above.
