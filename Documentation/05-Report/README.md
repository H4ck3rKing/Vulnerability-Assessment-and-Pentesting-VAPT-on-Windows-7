# VAPT Project Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the findings, exploits, and recommendations from the Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) conducted on a Windows 7 system. The project aimed to identify security vulnerabilities and demonstrate their exploitation using various tools and techniques.

## Executive Summary

### Project Objectives

- **Identify Vulnerabilities:** Utilized reconnaissance and scanning tools to discover potential weaknesses.
- **Exploit Vulnerabilities:** Demonstrated exploitation techniques to gain unauthorized access.
- **Document Findings:** Comprehensive documentation including step-by-step procedures and screenshots.
- **Recommendations:** Provided actionable steps to mitigate identified risks and enhance security posture.

### Key Findings

- **Reconnaissance:** Identified live hosts and services running on the Windows 7 system.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Discovered critical vulnerabilities through Nessus scans.
- **Exploitation:** Successfully exploited vulnerabilities such as EternalBlue and BlueKeep.
- **Post-Exploitation:** Gathered sensitive information and demonstrated persistence techniques.

## Detailed Findings

### Reconnaissance

Detailed findings from the reconnaissance phase, including network topology and identified hosts.

### Vulnerability Scanning

A comprehensive list of vulnerabilities identified during Nessus scans, categorized by severity.

### Exploitation

Detailed descriptions of successful exploits, including tools used and impact on the target system.

### Post-Exploitation

Summary of activities conducted after gaining initial access, such as data exfiltration and privilege escalation.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

- **Patch Management:** Apply security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **Access Controls:** Implement stricter access controls and least privilege principles.
- **Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect and respond to suspicious activities.

### Long-Term Measures

- **Security Awareness:** Conduct regular security training for employees and system administrators.
- **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and test an incident response plan to handle security breaches effectively.

## Conclusion

The VAPT project highlighted critical security vulnerabilities in the Windows 7 environment and demonstrated the importance of proactive security measures. By addressing the findings and implementing the recommended actions, organizations can strengthen their overall security posture and mitigate potential risks effectively.
