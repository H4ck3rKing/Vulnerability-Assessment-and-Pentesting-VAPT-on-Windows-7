# Post-Exploitation

## Overview

In this step, we perform post-exploitation activities on the compromised Windows 7 system to gather further information and maintain access. We use tools like Metasploit and custom scripts to achieve this.

## Tools Used

- Metasploit
- Custom scripts

## Steps and Commands

### Gathering System Information

**Tool: Metasploit**
```bash
sysinfo
```
*Description: This command gathers basic system information from the compromised host.*

### Dumping Password Hashes

**Tool: Metasploit**

```bash
hashdump
```

*Description: This command dumps password hashes from the compromised host.*

As shown in the image above, once a system is compromized, I was able to get the password hashes for all the users on the target system. What I did was to use a Password cracking tool called Ophcrack to crack these passwords and see their plaintext as shown below:

And after cracking the passwords, I was able to crack one of the accounts passwords as shown below:

### Persistence Techniques

**Technique: Adding a new user**
```bash
net user attacker password123 /add
net localgroup administrators attacker /add
```

*Description: These commands create a new user and add them to the administrators group to maintain access.*

## Findings

- **System Information:** Summarize the gathered system information.
- **Password Hashes:** Discuss the retrieved password hashes and potential use for further exploitation.

## Recommendations

- Regularly monitor and audit user accounts.
- Implement strong password policies and use multi-factor authentication.
