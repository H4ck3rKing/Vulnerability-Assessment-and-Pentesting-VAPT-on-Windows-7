## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to conduct an advanced Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) on a Windows 7 system. Using various tools and techniques, this project aims to identify, exploit, and document known vulnerabilities, thereby demonstrating practical cybersecurity skills in a controlled environment.
### Structure of the Documentation

- [Reconnaissance](./Documentation/01-Reconnaissance/)
- [Vulnerability Scanning](./Documentation/02-Vulnerability_Scanning/)
- [Exploitation](./Documentation/03-Exploitation/)
- [Post-Exploitation](./Documentation/04-Post-Exploitation/)
- [Scripts](./Documentation/05-Scripts/)
- [Report](./Documentation/06-Report/)

### Key Objectives

- Identify Vulnerabilities: Use reconnaissance and scanning tools to find potential security weaknesses in the Windows 7 system.
- Exploit Vulnerabilities: Apply exploitation techniques to gain unauthorized access and demonstrate the impact of each vulnerability.
- Document Findings: Provide detailed documentation of each step, including screenshots and remediation advice.
- Enhance Security Awareness: Highlight the importance of regular updates, proper configuration, and strong security practices.

### Target System

- Operating System: Windows 7
- Environment: Isolated test network
