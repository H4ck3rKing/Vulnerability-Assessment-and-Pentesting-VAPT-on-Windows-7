## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to conduct an advanced Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) on a Windows 7 system. Using various tools and techniques, this project aims to identify, exploit, and document known vulnerabilities, thereby demonstrating practical cybersecurity skills in a controlled environment.

### Key Objectives:

- **Identify Vulnerabilities:** Use reconnaissance and scanning tools to find potential security weaknesses in the Windows 7 system.
- **Exploit Vulnerabilities:** Apply exploitation techniques to gain unauthorized access and demonstrate the impact of each vulnerability.
- **Document Findings:** Provide detailed documentation of each step, including screenshots and remediation advice.
- **Enhance Security Awareness:** Highlight the importance of regular updates, proper configuration, and strong security practices.

### Target System:

- **Operating System:** Windows 7
- **Environment:** Isolated test network

### Tools Used:

- **Nmap:** Network exploration tool and security scanner.
- **Netdiscover:** Network reconnaissance tool.
- **Nessus:** Vulnerability scanner.
- **Metasploit:** Penetration testing framework.
- **Hydra:** Password brute-forcing tool.
- **MSFvenom:** Custom payload generator.

### Exploits Covered:

1. **EternalBlue (MS17-010)**
2. **BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708)**
3. **Weak RDP Credentials**
4. **Internet Explorer Vulnerability (CVE-2015-2426)**
5. **DLL Hijacking**
6. **Privilege Escalation (CVE-2016-0099)**

### Structure of the Documentation:

- **Reconnaissance:** Techniques and tools used to gather information about the target system.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Tools and methods used to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **Exploitation:** Step-by-step process of exploiting identified vulnerabilities.
- **Post-Exploitation:** Activities performed after gaining access to the system.
- **Findings and Remediation:** Summary of findings and recommended remediation steps.
