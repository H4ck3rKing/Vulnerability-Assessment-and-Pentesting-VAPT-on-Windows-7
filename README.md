## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to conduct an advanced Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) on a Windows 7 system. Using various tools and techniques, this project aims to identify, exploit, and document known vulnerabilities, thereby demonstrating practical cybersecurity skills in a controlled environment.

### Key Objectives

- Identify Vulnerabilities: Use reconnaissance and scanning tools to find potential security weaknesses in the Windows 7 system.
- Exploit Vulnerabilities: Apply exploitation techniques to gain unauthorized access and demonstrate the impact of each vulnerability.
- Document Findings: Provide detailed documentation of each step, including screenshots and remediation advice.
- Enhance Security Awareness: Highlight the importance of regular updates, proper configuration, and strong security practices.

### Target System

- Operating System: Windows 7
- Environment: Isolated test network
