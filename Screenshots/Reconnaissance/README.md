# Reconnaissance

## Overview

In this step, we perform reconnaissance to gather information about the target Windows 7 system. We use tools like Netdiscover and Nmap to identify live hosts and services running on the target machine.

## Tools Used

- Netdiscover
- Nmap

## Steps and Commands

### Identify Live Hosts

**Tool:** Netdiscover

```bash
netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24
```
*Description: This command discovers live hosts within the specified subnet.*


### Perform a Detailed Scan

**Tool: Nmap**
```bash
nmap -A -T4 192.168.1.100
```

*Description: This Nmap command performs a comprehensive scan to gather information about the target system.*

## Findings

- **Live Hosts Identified:** List IP addresses and MAC addresses.
- **Open Ports and Services:** Detail the services running on each open port.

## Recommendations

- Use firewalls to restrict unnecessary ports.
- Regularly monitor network traffic to detect unauthorized access.
